# Secure Agent Playbook

An open-source security playbook for AI agents. Structured, OWASP-grounded procedures that enable agents to perform security engineering tasks — from code review to AI agent security audits.

## Why Use This?

Without a playbook, asking an AI agent to "review my code for security" gives you a surface-level checklist. With these plays, the agent follows a structured OWASP-grounded procedure — systematically testing every vulnerability class, producing findings with CWE mappings, OpenCRE cross-references, evidence snippets, and specific remediation code.

- **Consistent methodology** — Every assessment follows a documented procedure, not ad-hoc prompting. Results are reproducible across runs and reviewers.
- **Structured, actionable output** — Findings include severity, CWE, evidence, and remediation steps with code examples. No vague warnings.
- **Cross-standard traceability** — Findings link to CWE, ASVS, WSTG, and NIST 800-53 via [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org) for compliance mapping.
- **17 security skills** — From dependency CVE scanning to prompt injection testing to multi-agent threat modeling. Install as a Claude Code plugin or use standalone.
- **Works beyond Claude Code** — Skills are Claude Code plugins; plays are standalone procedures any AI agent can follow.

## What This Is

This is not a framework or a library. There is no code to import.

Each **play** is a step-by-step security procedure with checklists, decision criteria, and output templates. An AI agent follows the procedure to produce consistent, evidence-based findings. Think of it like a SOC analyst's playbook — but written for AI agents to execute.

## Quick Start

**With Claude Code (recommended):**

**Step 1** — Register the plugin marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace add OWASP/secure-agent-playbook
```

**Step 2** — Install a skill set:
```
/plugin install code-security-skills@agent-security-playbook
/plugin install ai-security-skills@agent-security-playbook
```

**Step 3** — Use the skills by mentioning the task in conversation:

```
"Review this code for security issues"
"Scan my dependencies for CVEs"
"Audit this MCP server configuration"
"Test this chatbot for prompt injection"
```

Claude will automatically activate the relevant skill based on context. See [Skills Catalog](#skills-catalog) for all available skills and [Example Output](#example-output) for what the results look like.

**Organization plugin** — For Claude organization admins installing via [Organization Plugins](https://claude.ai/admin-settings/plugins):

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/OWASP/secure-agent-playbook/releases/latest)
2. Download `secure-agent-playbook.zip` from the release assets
3. Upload the zip at **Organization settings > Plugins > Add plugin**

> **Note:** Do not use GitHub's "Download ZIP" button — it nests files in a subdirectory that the plugin validator rejects. Always use the release asset zip.

**Local development** — To test from a local clone instead of GitHub:
```
/plugin marketplace add /path/to/agent-security-playbook
/plugin install code-security-skills@agent-security-playbook
/plugin install ai-security-skills@agent-security-playbook
```

**Without Claude Code:**

Reference plays directly as procedures for any AI agent or manual use:
- Point your agent at a play: *"Follow the procedure in `plugins/ai-security-skills/plays/agent-security-audit.md`"*
- Or use the plays as checklists for manual security reviews

**Codex, OpenCode, and standalone installs:** The installer builds Codex plugin
manifests and complete target-owned packages from canonical plugins. For a
guided standalone install to Codex or the OpenCode compatibility surface, run
`python3 tools/install_skills.py`. The installer saves its first-run choices
and replays them with `--yes`. Use `--with-data` to materialize cited plugin
datasets; `--status`, `--update`, and `--uninstall` manage a saved install.

## Agents

Agents are autonomous security specialists that invoke skills and produce structured reports. Each agent has a focused system prompt, scoped tool access, and preloaded skills. Use them individually or as a coordinated team.

| Agent | Focus | Skills Invoked |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `code-security-reviewer` | Code vulnerabilities, secrets, web security | code-review-security, secrets-scan, web-security-review |
| `dependency-auditor` | Supply chain and dependency CVE risks | sca-audit |
| `api-security-reviewer` | API security against OWASP API Top 10 | api-security-review |
| `mobile-security-reviewer` | Native Android/iOS source against OWASP MASVS v2.1.0 | mobile-code-review |
| `ai-security-assessor` | Agent configs, MCP servers, LLM app risks | agent-security-audit, mcp-server-review, llm-risk-assess, prompt-injection-test |
| `security-team-lead` | Coordinates specialists, consolidates report | securability-engineering-review |

**Standalone usage** — invoke any agent directly:
```
"Use code-security-reviewer to review src/"
"Use dependency-auditor to scan this project"
```

**Team assessment** — with agent teams enabled, the team lead dispatches specialists in parallel and consolidates findings into a single report:
```
"Run a full security assessment of this project"
```

The team lead scopes the target, dispatches relevant specialists (skipping those whose focus area isn't present), deduplicates findings, identifies cross-domain risk chains, and produces a unified report using `templates/report.md`.

> Agent teams requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. See [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams) for setup. Individual agents work without this flag.

## Example Output

Running `"Review src/auth/ for security issues"` on a Node.js/Express codebase produces findings like this:

```
Security Code Review — src/auth/
Scope: Node.js/Express, server-side, processes user credentials
Findings: CRITICAL 1 | HIGH 2 | MEDIUM 1 | LOW 0
```

### [CRITICAL] SQL Injection in User Lookup

- **CWE**: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
- **OpenCRE**: [CRE-764-507](https://www.opencre.org/cre/764-507) — Injection Prevention
- **OWASP Ref**: A03:2021 Injection
- **Location**: `src/auth/login.js:42`
- **Impact**: Attacker can extract the entire users table, bypass authentication, or execute arbitrary SQL via crafted `id` parameter
- **Evidence**:
  ```js
  // src/auth/login.js:42
  const user = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + req.params.id);
  ```
- **Remediation**: Use parameterized queries:
  ```js
  const user = await db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", [req.params.id]);
  ```
- **Confidence**: HIGH

> Every skill produces structured findings with severity, CWE, evidence, and remediation code.
> See [`examples/`](examples/) for complete sample assessment reports.

## Architecture

Three-layer design — every layer lives inside the plugin source folder so the marketplace install bundles everything the skills need:

- **`plugins/<name>/agents/`** — Autonomous security specialists with focused system prompts, co-located inside each plugin. Each agent invokes one or more skills, operates in an isolated context, and produces structured reports. Can work solo or as a coordinated team.
- **`plugins/<name>/skills/`** — Self-contained `SKILL.md` files following the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/specification). Distributed through `plugins/code-security-skills/` and `plugins/ai-security-skills/`, registered in the marketplace via `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Each skill summarizes a procedure and references its corresponding play inside the same plugin.
- **`plugins/<name>/plays/`** — Full reference procedures with detailed checklists, tables, decision criteria, and examples. Skills reference these for comprehensive coverage.
- **`plugins/<name>/templates/`** and **`plugins/<name>/data/`** — Output templates (`finding.md`, `report.md`) and OWASP reference datasets (FIASSE v1.0.4, ASVS v5.0, secure-code prompts) that skills load at runtime.

Agents orchestrate, skills execute, plays provide the full procedure. Contributors edit plays. This means the playbook works with any AI agent (just point it at a play), while Claude Code users get plugin-based installation with agents and skills.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

New plays should:
- Solve one well-defined security task
- Include clear trigger conditions (when should this play run?)
- Follow a structured procedure with checkpoints
- Produce findings using the in-plugin `templates/finding.md` format
- Reference OWASP standards where applicable
- Prefer existing tools (semgrep, trivy, osv-scanner, trufflehog) over reimplementing detection
- Live inside the appropriate plugin's `plays/` folder so they ship with the marketplace install
